To Do

Xu Chen stared outside the shaking carriage, bummed about his trip to Bai Lao city. Nothing had panned out as he had hoped. On days like this, he missed Coco, his pet cockroach. It had been a good companion - attentive, a good listener, and adventurous, until it fell out of his pocket and drowned in the school toilet bowl. 

As the excitement of transmigration finally faded, he realized that he had never really been lucky. He had been deluding himself with fancy dreams of bitch-slapping some young masters, and forgot that he never had a golden spoon. Rather, he was meant to eat all his meals by hand.

His parents tried to console in the Bai Lao city, but stopped bothering him when he showed no interest in talking. The quiet carriage ride was followed by a swaying ride on the gondola across the Amera river that divided the two cities. He just watched the stream of water under him hit the pedals that powered the gondola. This world was indeed more advanced than he had imagined. 

For one, steam towers and factories with assembly lines lines the skyline of Bai Lao city in the distance. They mass produced goods like weapons and furniture, and had strict standardization of various forms. 

Second, the society wasn't agrarian. There were a lot of advanced professions, like his parents who were doctors that specialized in certain ailments. Both cities had democratic governance councils, hunter associations, internal police, etc. There wasn't much difference in treatment of common people vs cultivators. 

He felt his head get heavy trying to juggle all the thoughts he had. His soul really was damaged. Chen Xiaobai had taken him to a specialist in the Bai Lao city. She had known it herself but she had wanted to be wrong. He too had lost something vital when that doctor pronounced his results.

Still, he persevered. He had to make a list. He felt the information from Earth slowly slipping from his grasp, like grains of sand falling down the hourglass. 

It was quite dark by the time they reached the town. They made their way to their home in the clan's territory. Xu Chen rushed back to his room, technically his first time at the place. He had to update his To Do list urgently.

Possible paths to success
- ~~Awaken awesome abilities~~
- ~~Be born a genius~~
- Find an overpowered ancient heirloom / artefact
- Find a hermit teacher who is a monster
- Invent technology from earth and become rich

From this list, he had just crossed out 1 and 2 after the horrible Awakening Ceremony. Given his luck, he felt 3 and 4 were also unlikely. He had been looking around he downtown market but felt no Spider sense for any object. It was going to be a long road if he wanted to find some low hanging fruit that hadn't already been plucked.

He was particularly excited about the last one. In the few days he had roamed the markets, he found there was a market for a many things he had known on earth. Things like matchboxes and safety razors would be very lucrative. There were already assembly lines so he wouldn't have to invent those. He could maybe make guns too, though he wasn't sure of it.
