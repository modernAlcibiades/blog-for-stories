# World Building
## Spiritual Energy
- There are multiple types of energies, each convertible into another to some extent.
  - Thermal Source : Everything that moves needs thermal energy. Surprisingly, plants are a good source of thermal energy since they collect it naturally but never use. Solar energy is also a form of pure thermal energy. Elements : Light, Fire, Lightning, Wind, Sound. Boosts agility.
  - Mass Source : Energy that provides weight and strength. More mass source means a stronger sense of existence and more inertia. Things accumulate mass source by retaining their state and properties. Elements : Dark, Earth, Air, Water, Wood, Metal. Boost strength and defense.
  - Soul Source : Energy that creates consciousness and life. This can speed up reproduction, and allows control of other sources of energy. Improves longevity and understanding of the world. Elements : Shadow, Space, Psychic, Summoning, Beastmaster, Time
  - Void Source : Most primary form of energy. Almost everywhere but those sparse to collect. Elements : All

- Levels of cultivation : Defined by density and total amount of energy. Not definitive in terms of combat. Defined in terms of exponential growth. 
  - Practitioner : 10 realms of existence. Each realm is double the total energy of the prior. The density is an important factor factions use to determine promising candidates. Beasts are also classified ie a Wolfhound is at realm 3.
    - Practitioner Realm x = 2^x * (realm 1 = Energy in a healthy human body)
  - Warrior : 10 realms of existence. Defined by the total density and total energy. A realm 10 Practitioner can be realm 1 Warrior or realm 3 Warrior.
    - Warrior Realm x = Energy density : atleast x*(solar energy density) (of one type of source) and atleast total x*(realm x Practitioner)
  - Expert : Powerhouses with high density of energy and a deep spirit source. At this point, they have to specialize in the type of energy they use and learn to free form the energy instead of using prescribed methods of use. They must drop the crutch that they used to learn.

- Effects of energy
  - Spiritual energy source affects the personality. Void source is the best in that regard since it doesn't. It is possible to guess the type of one's source based on the energy that constantly leaks from them.
  - Higher the energy density in a body, the more it leaks. High density individuals find it hard to stay in the upper mountains since they must constantly spend energy trying to maintain the density and it is hard to refill their Sources.

## Culture
- Cultivation
  - All physical practitioners are Mass cultivators. At early levels, mass energy can be stored in body parts, improving their durability, providing a boost to physical attributes.
  - Energy Sources : beyond realm 3, Practitioners need to incorporate external Sources in their bodies. There are multiple methods -
    - embedding animal and plant cores in their organs : rough, high burst power, low efficiency, low stamina. Default method since it requires basic soul power.
    - processing cores into smaller elements and embedding in different parts of the body : high chance of failure during placement, expensive, but very effective and allows much more control. High soul power requirement from the user.
    - converting core into medicine. Transform the body's cells to incorporate the cores and provide the power inherently : Very expensive. Temporary. The medicine must be consumed every few months until cells inherently change and maintain the ability. Minimal soul power requirement and qualitatively improve the body. Such users cannot survive in the upper mountains since they leak enormous amounts of energy.
  
- Prohibited practices
  - Cannibalism : People who eat other humans since that is the easiest way to improve their cultivation. Any other way of drawing energy from humans is pointless since it is easier to use animals and plants instead. Cannibalism is prohibited.


## Geography
A giant rocky planet that is spiky like a sea urchin. Each of the spikes is a mountain thousands of kilometers wide at the base and 10s of kilometers tall at the peak. Each mountain is divided into multiple regions
- Deepness : The deepest parts between mountains where water collects to form seas. These seas are often connected to the neighboring seas during peak summer but get separated due to volcanic activity or frozen channels or lack of water.
- Forbidden zones : The areas right in the foothills next to the seas. The spiritual energy is the most concentrated in these zones. Very often the areas are jungles and giant overpowered land beasts live there with their underlings. The land and sea creatures fight each other. These areas are not habitable and not much is known about them. (a few clans live in particular geographic zones that are defensible and allow access to shallow seas. These are major ports.)
- Twilight zone : Due to gigantic forests that grow super tall in the forbidden zones, and the shadow of the mountains, these areas have a completely different geography.
