# Time Turner

## 1. External Progression
The Time Turner learns abilities based on external environment and how to manipulate it.
### Changing the Perception
Perception that allows controlling outcomes of an action, like redirecting a ball by hitting it, or catching a fish barehanded. Everyone has this ability but the Time Turner has more degrees of freedom as they grow. This is the common part of how things happen in real life, like ducking your head to avoid a ball, pulling hand back from fire, etc. The characteristic of a Time Turner exhibits a faster reaction time and an overall better awareness of the surroundings. This is stage is mostly an unconscious growth and makes the character stand out due to good agility and aptitude.

### Changing the Future
A qualitative change from previous step when someone begins to actively control the ability to predict the future. This manifests in split second decisions that can have huge impact. The characteristic exhibited can be classified as quick thinking. Consumes a lot of soul power so the character feels exhausted all the time.
Time Turners exhibit signs of isolation here as they find out they are different. Often praised by others.

### Changing the Present
Reversing a process like attaching a falling apple back to the tree. Can only be done for actions not observed by other sentient creatures. In the beginning, touch is required and can be indistinguishable from Changing the Future, e.g. touch a rock to stop the internal structure from collapsing. Over time, it extends to other senses, like catching a falling apple and putting it back on the tree. The reversal is restricted, ie the path cannot be changed from the original trajectory of the object hence apple will be reattached the same way it was attached.
The change can only be done to things that are not actively observed by anyone else. This also causes people to not believe the Time Turner when they manifest their ability but cannot prove it since it hasn't been observed. Time Turners feel more isolated as they are mocked and find themselves unable to convince others.

### Changing the Unseen
Action at a distance. The Time Turner can affect things that are unseen and isolated. The range improves and anything recently touched or seen can be manipulated under the same rules are Changing the Present. This stage is only possible through a lot of experimentation and requires strong observational powers. The Time Turner starts understanding when things are under observation and is able to deduce information from minute changes in their own ability to manipulate objects.

### Changing the Seen
Creating illusions for observers, redirecting attention to change the things under observation. A sort of magic trick so the Time Turner can manipulate objects by first redirecting attention, then changing the object. Some objects by their very nature have this property, like Guitar Picks, Eyeglasses, etc. A side-effect of this is invisibility ie redirecting attention from oneself. Requires extreme patience, self-control, and dependant on external circumstances like number of observers, number of objects in the vicinity, soul power, amount of ambient light and sound, etc.

## 2. Internal Progression
At this point, the Time Turner must turn inwards and manipulate themselves to get further with their abilities. 
### Changing the Senses
Choosing what your own senses tell you. Replacing your own senses. A lot of limitations of Time-Turners are due to what they themselves have observed and hence the manipulation path is limited by this observation. Requires closing of one's senses and feeling the world anew. Can be lethal is important senses are turned off and cannot be turned on again when needed. At this point, the paths to the past can be many. For example, if you only felt the apple falling down but didn't see it, you can reattach it the tree in a possibly different place and orientation, depending on how well they can manipulate themselves.
Quite likely to go insane in this stage. Hard to tell what is real and what isn't.

### Changing the Body
Once the Time Turner can selectively ignore their perception. Allows to speed up healing, reverse injuries and damage, as well as a control over feelings. One can remember anything they ever sensed, as long as they can distinguish it from the illusions they put themselves under. It is an eternal game against oneself. Many of the Time Turners end up as newborn children or die of old age as they manipulate time beyond their abilities. They are already immortal at this point.

### Changing the World
Change people without them noticing. Make people fall in love and out again. Heal (reverse) wounds. Make them age. Change the world in whatever image you want. The final goal is reversing Time itself.
